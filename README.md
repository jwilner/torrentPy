#torrentPy

An exploration of the BitTorrent protocol in Python, using just select to handle the sockets. The only non-standard dependencies are the bitarray package, Requests, and a plugin to make Requests nonblocking.

This currently works enough to effectively download a test case, but much strategy remains to be fleshed out. We'll see if I ever get to it.
